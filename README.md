Argh! Pirate Chatter
====================
Our second favorite day of the year at CloudSpokes is International Talk Like A Pirate Day (September 19th). Since ITLAP Day falls this year in the middle of Dreamforce, we thought it would be fun to write an app that "piratizes your chatter posts". 

How much fun would it be to have the SVP of Sales in your organization post to chatter:

  "Hey Jim!! Do you want to meet with the customer for lunch?"

and it shows up as:

  Ahoy Jim!! Do ye wants t' meet wit' th' customer fer grub?
